## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Ans : general purpose - is a programming language designed 
to be used for creating software in different types of application, independetnt of hardware configurations and operating systems . 
high-level programming : Easy to understand , less memory efficient , easy to debug Also can run in any platfrom , needs compiler or interpreter for translation.
Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
pros : open source  , easy syntax  , Interpreted Language(run code line by line so if any error occures then it stops) , lots of library support .
cons : slow speed , Not Memory Efficient (automatically assigns the data type during execution)

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

1. Bigdata domain  , web , Machine learning , Artifical Intelegency

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

A varibale is a reserved memory location to strore values
E.g test=100
Here "test" is varibale and its value is 100

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans: input() 
e.g input("Enter name:")

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

Ans: string

Q8. What is type casting?
it is method to convert varibale data type into differnet data type.
e,g # int variable
      a = 5
 
   # typecast to float
     n = float(a)

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

yes , e.g a, b, c = input("Enter three differnt names: ").split()

Q10. What are keywords?
keywords are reserved words that cannot be used as variable names, function names.
e.g and , as

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
No , we can nt use keywords as a variable . Beacause keyword is reserved and if we use it will throw error (SyntaxError: invalid syntax)

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Indentation is a spaces at the beginning of a code line.
 indentation to highlight the blocks of code in python.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
by using print();
Q14. What are operators in Python?

Arithmetic operators (+,-,/,*,%)
Assignment operators (= , +=,-=,*=)
Comparison operators (==,>,<,>=,<=)
Logical operators (and,or,not)
Identity Operators(is,is not)

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Both are arithmetic operator
x = 15
y = 2
/ = used in division  , Gives actual rsult e.g print(x/y) = 7.5
// = this floor division , rounds the result to the nearest whole number e.g print(x//y) = 7 

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans: print('iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron');
Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
 Ans:
print("Enter your number:")
num = input();
if(int(num) % 2 == 0):
 print("even")
else:
 print("odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?

operators and,or,not are boolean operators .

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 : 1

0 and 0 : 0

True and False and True : False

1 or 0 or 0 : 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
if,else,

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

Ans: If the condition for if is False, it checks the condition of the next elif block . if elif is false then it goes to else.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
print("Enter Age:")
age = input();
if(int(age) >= 18):
 print("I can vote")
else:
 print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans: 
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50];
sumOfEvenNumbers = 0;
for num in numbers:
    if(num%2==0):
        sumOfEvenNumbers = sumOfEvenNumbers + num
print("sum of even number is:" , sumOfEvenNumbers)

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter third number: "))

if (num1 >= num2) and (num1 >= num3):
   greatest = num1
elif (num2 >= num1) and (num2 >= num3):
   greatest = num2
else:
   greatest = num3

print("The greatest number is", greatest)

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

for nums in numbers:
    if(nums>500)
        continue
    elif(nums>150):
        continue
    elif(nums%5==0):
        print(nums);

o/p: 75 150 145

Q76. Write a Python program to find the factorial of a given number.

n = 5
fac  = 1
if n < 0:
   print("Invalid!")
elif n == 0:
   print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
for num in range(1,n+1):
    fac = fac*num
print("Factorial of ",n,'=',fac)

Q77. Write a Python program to calculate the simple interest. Formula to calculate simple interest is SI = (PRT)/100

#principal
P = 3000
#Rate of interest
R = 4.5
#Time periof (In year)
T = 5

SI = (P*R*T)/100
print("Simple Interest is",SI)
